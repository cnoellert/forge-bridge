# forge-bridge

**forge-bridge** is a protocol-agnostic communication middleware for post-production pipelines. It enables any piece of software — Flame, Maya, editorial systems, shot tracking databases, AI models, custom scripts — to communicate through a shared, semantically-rich vocabulary.

forge-bridge is not a Flame utility. It is infrastructure. Flame is one endpoint. Everything else is another.

---

## Vision

Modern post-production involves many disparate software systems that have no native way to talk to each other. A "shot" in Flame, a "clip" in Resolve, an "entity" in ShotGrid, a "sequence" in an NLE — these are all pointing at the same real-world thing. forge-bridge holds the map and carries the messages.

The core insight: define a canonical vocabulary once. Each connected system provides a thin adapter that maps its native concepts to bridge's language. After that, any two systems that both speak bridge can communicate without knowing anything about each other.

### Current Implementation (Phase 1)

The current implementation is the **Flame endpoint** — an HTTP bridge that allows external processes to execute Python code inside a running Flame instance, and receive results back.

This consists of two parts:

**Flame-side hook** (`flame_hooks/forge_bridge/scripts/forge_bridge.py`)
An HTTP server running inside Flame on port 9999. Accepts Python code via `POST /exec`, executes it on Flame's Qt main thread via `schedule_idle_event`, and returns stdout/stderr/result as JSON.

**MCP client layer** (`forge_bridge/`)
A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that wraps the bridge's HTTP interface as structured tools, making the Flame Python API accessible to LLM agents.

## Current Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Flame HTTP bridge | ✅ Working |
| MCP server (LLM tools) | ✅ Working |
| Canonical vocabulary spec | 🔧 In design |
| Dependency graph engine | 📋 Planned |
| Maya endpoint | 📋 Planned |
| Editorial/shot tracking adapters | 📋 Planned |
| Event-driven channel system | 📋 Planned |

---

## Quick Start

### Install the Flame hook

Copy `flame_hooks/forge_bridge/scripts/forge_bridge.py` to your Flame Python hooks directory:

```
/opt/Autodesk/shared/python/forge_bridge/scripts/forge_bridge.py
```

Flame will load it automatically on startup. The bridge starts on `http://127.0.0.1:9999/` by default.

**Environment variables:**
```
FORGE_BRIDGE_HOST=0.0.0.0     # bind to LAN (default: 127.0.0.1)
FORGE_BRIDGE_PORT=9999        # port (default: 9999)
FORGE_BRIDGE_ENABLED=0        # disable entirely
```

### Install the MCP server

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Run the MCP server

```bash
# Local (stdio — for use with Claude Desktop or similar)
python -m forge_bridge

# Remote Flame (bridge on another machine)
python -m forge_bridge --bridge-host 192.168.1.100

# HTTP transport (multi-client)
python -m forge_bridge --http --port 8080
```

### Test the connection

Open `http://localhost:9999/` in a browser for the interactive Python console. Type `flame` to confirm the Flame API is available.

## Relationship to projekt-forge

forge-bridge is extracted from [projekt-forge](https://github.com/cnoellert/projekt-forge), which is the project management frontend for Flame-based pipelines. projekt-forge creates and manages projects, folder structures, and pipeline configurations.

forge-bridge is the communication infrastructure that projekt-forge and other tools connect to. It is developed and versioned independently so it can serve as a stable platform for any number of tools without being coupled to any single one.

---

## Design Principles

**Bridge is neutral.** It does not prefer Flame over Maya, or any software over another. All endpoints are equal participants.

**Vocabulary is primary.** The canonical language is the most important design surface. Get it right and everything else follows. See [VOCABULARY.md](docs/VOCABULARY.md).

**Dependencies are inferred, not declared.** When data flows into bridge, the relationships and dependencies within it are parsed and recorded automatically. Artists do not declare dependencies — the graph builds itself from the natural structure of the work.

**Local first.** Bridge runs locally to start. The architecture does not prevent future network or cloud deployment, but does not require it.

**Authentication is deferred, not ignored.** The message format and connection model are designed to accommodate auth context. It is not implemented yet. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current thinking.
