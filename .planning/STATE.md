# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** Make forge-bridge the single canonical pip package so projekt-forge can consume it rather than duplicate it
**Current focus:** Phase 06 — learning-pipeline-integration (Phase 5 verified 2026-04-18, 6/6 UAT)

## Current Position

Phase: 6
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase 05 verified (UAT 6/6) — ready to plan Phase 6
Last activity: 2026-04-18

Progress: [██████████] 100% (v1.1 milestone — 5 of 5 Phase 5 plans done)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.0 Phase 3]: Synthesized tools must use bridge.execute(), never import flame — tools run in MCP server process, not inside Flame
- [v1.0 Phase 3]: Manifest-based file validation in watcher prevents arbitrary code execution from rogue synthesized files
- [v1.1 Roadmap]: Phase ordering is strict — Phase 5 cannot start until Phase 4 is complete; Phase 6 cannot start until both are done
- [Plan 05-00]: Four projekt-forge fixes ported upstream (query_lineage/query_shot_deps/media_scan builders, entity_list narrowing, ref_msg_id correlation fallback, timeline T0 gap-fill) — released as forge-bridge v1.0.1 so projekt-forge can delete local duplicates in Wave B
- [Plan 05-00]: `project_name` kwarg on AsyncClient.__init__ stays in projekt-forge fork (NOT upstreamed) — forge-specific multi-project routing, per RESEARCH §D-09b
- [Plan 05-01]: Single atomic commit over rename-aware 1597-line diff chosen over the 2-commit split heuristic — the work is mechanical/programmatic and reviewers benefit more from `git diff --find-renames` on the combined rewrite than from an artificial rename-first/sed-second separation
- [Plan 05-01]: sed rewrite scope expanded beyond plan's `from forge_bridge\.` pattern to cover (1) bare `from forge_bridge import bridge` imports in projekt_forge/tools/, (2) quoted string-literal `unittest.mock.patch("forge_bridge...")` targets across 9 test files, (3) `import forge_bridge.X as Y` statements, and (4) filesystem-path string literals in 2 static-analysis tests — all variants of the same local-package-reference rewrite the plan intended
- [Plan 05-01]: Cosmetic `forge_bridge` mentions (log channel name, FastMCP display name, argparse prog, usage-text `python -m forge_bridge`) intentionally left for Wave C's server/mcp.py + __main__.py rewrite — no runtime/test impact in Wave A
- [Plan 05-02]: D-09b resolved to branch-b (preserve local clients) — projekt-forge's db_server relies on extended HELLO project_name for per-project DB routing; swapping to canonical pip AsyncClient would silently break DB routing. All 3 client files retained: client/__init__.py, client/async_client.py, client/sync_client.py.
- [Plan 05-02]: Two-commit execution instead of single — a precondition fix(hooks) commit (4d2b579) for the sys.path.insert→append collision at 17 sites, then the atomic refactor(projekt_forge) RWR-02 commit (9856376). The plan wrote "single atomic commit" but the hook issue was discovered during Wave B execution and its fix is mechanically separate from RWR-02 (pip-dep + deletes + import flips remain atomic in commit 9856376).
- [Plan 05-02]: tests/test_switch_grade_mcp.py pared from 22 to 15 tests per user-approved Option 1 — deleted 7 projekt-forge-specific tests asserting on fork-only SwitchGradeInput fields (alternative_path/alternative_start_frame/alternative_duration/entity_id), server-side openclip writer (_write_openclip_server_side / forge_openclip_writer / _switch.clip naming), and UUID path construction. Rewrote 4 tests to use pip's media_path field. Coverage of pip surface maintained and expanded.
- [Plan 05-02]: D-12 discovered during execution — Flame hook scripts' sys.path.insert(0, scripts_dir) shadows pip forge_bridge/ because scripts dir contains sibling forge_bridge.py hook module. Resolution: insert→append at 17 sites; 05-04's autouse conftest fixture is the long-term guard.
- [Plan 05-02]: Pytest invocation standardized to `pytest tests/` (explicit path) — default `pytest` collection in projekt-forge pollutes from flame_hooks/forge_tools/forge_bridge/scripts/forge_llm_test.py (matches *_test.py AND sys.exit(1) on Ollama offline). Pre-existing issue noted in SUMMARY but not fixed in 05-02.
- [Phase 05]: [Plan 05-03]: Expanded Task 2 scope to cover projekt_forge/server/__init__.py as a Rule 3 blocking auto-fix -- the package __init__ re-exported 'main' from server.mcp which Task 1 explicitly removed, so without the three-file atomic commit the package becomes unimportable mid-wave. The alternative (split the __init__ fix into a separate commit) would have broken RWR-03's atomic-commit requirement.
- [Phase 05]: [Plan 05-03]: Introduced _run_mcp_only(args) helper in __main__.py instead of leaving the two 'from projekt_forge.server.mcp import main as mcp_main' callers dangling -- the helper configures the bridge via forge_bridge.bridge.configure and calls mcp.run() directly, so the canonical FastMCP lifespan owns startup_bridge/shutdown_bridge per Phase 4 API-04/API-05 and projekt-forge never duplicates the lifecycle.
- [Phase 05]: [Plan 05-03]: Swept the Wave A cosmetic leftovers in __main__.py (argparse prog label, module docstring, logger channel name) from 'forge_bridge' to 'projekt_forge' in the same atomic commit as the architectural rewire -- Plan 05-01 SUMMARY flagged these as Wave C's responsibility.
- [Phase 05]: [Plan 05-04]: D-06 editable-shadow reconciliation handled per plan STEP 4 — uninstalled the editable forge-bridge shadow (0.1.0 from /Users/cnoellert/Documents/GitHub/forge-bridge) and installed forge-bridge 1.0.1 from the git tag into site-packages before committing the fixture. The fixture's site-packages assertion is by design incompatible with the editable dev loop; if the user reinstates the editable shadow for forge-bridge development, pytest will fail with a clear remediation message. This is the guard working as intended, not a regression.
- [Phase 05]: [Plan 05-04]: Duplicate `import pytest` omitted from the appended conftest block — plan STEP 3 explicitly permits this reconciliation when pytest is already imported at file top (it is, at line 17). `pathlib` and `forge_bridge` are new and stay inline for section cohesion per the plan's guidance. This is plan-approved, not a deviation.
- [Phase 05]: [Plan 05-04]: projekt-forge pyproject.toml missing `tool.hatch.metadata.allow-direct-references = true` prevents `pip install -e /path/to/projekt-forge` from resolving the forge-bridge git-URL dep. Worked around in this plan by installing forge-bridge directly from its git tag. Adding the hatchling flag to projekt-forge's pyproject.toml is a projekt-forge packaging concern flagged as follow-up — out of scope for RWR-04.
- [Phase 06 scope]: 2026-04-18 — SQL persistence backend for ExecutionLog (EXT-03) stays deferred to v1.1.x. Phase 6 focuses on LRN-01..04 wiring only: JSONL log path injection, LLMRouter construction from forge_config.yaml, storage callback hook, pre_synthesis_hook. Rationale: (1) v1.1 milestone goal is "wire it, don't redesign it" — integration, not persistence redesign; (2) projekt-forge already has its own DB layer that can consume the storage callback directly, so SQL-in-bridge isn't blocking; (3) Phase 5 scope already stretched three days — keeping Phase 6 focused minimizes schedule risk; (4) EXT-03 gets a dedicated v1.1.x patch when a consumer actually needs it.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: mcp/server.py lifespan refactor — promoting _startup/_shutdown to public requires confirming forge-bridge's own test suite does not depend on the private names before Phase 4 planning
- ~~[Phase 5]: Import blast radius in projekt-forge not yet measured~~ — RESOLVED: 179 `from forge_bridge.*` imports + 8 bare-module + 30+ patch-target variants all measured and rewritten in Plan 05-01
- ~~[Phase 6]: DB persistence scope in v1.1 not decided~~ — RESOLVED 2026-04-18: SQL backend for ExecutionLog (EXT-03) deferred to v1.1.x; Phase 6 focuses on wiring (LRN-01..04) with JSONL + storage callback. See Decisions for rationale.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| EXT | Shared synthesis manifest between repos (EXT-01) | Future requirement | v1.1 definition |
| EXT | Tool provenance in MCP annotations (EXT-02) | Future requirement | v1.1 definition |
| EXT | SQL persistence backend for ExecutionLog (EXT-03) | Future requirement | v1.1 definition |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-18
Stopped at: Phase 5 UAT verified 6/6 (cold install, public API, protocol builders + entity_list narrowing, projekt-forge suite 414 passed + 3 xfailed, RWR-04 guard fired on real-world fossil at projekt-forge repo root, MCP --help exits 0). Minor follow-up: expose forge_bridge.__version__ in v1.0.2. Ready to plan Phase 6 — open gate: SQL-backend-for-ExecutionLog scope (v1.1 or defer to v1.1.x).
